Electrozone is an online electronic store application built using Advanced Java along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The project provides a complete shopping workflow with the following features:

🔑 Admin Login – Admins can manage inventory, update product quantities, and oversee customer orders.

👤 Customer Login & Registration – New customers can register by filling out details through HTML forms, while existing customers can log in securely.

🛒 Product Selection – Customers can browse electronic gadgets, select a product, specify its quantity, and place an order.

📦 Inventory Management – The system tracks gadget quantities in real-time, ensuring stock availability is displayed before purchase.

💳 Order Placement & Billing – The application calculates the total amount based on product price and quantity, then confirms the order.

⚙️ Advanced Java Concepts Used

 Applied several Advanced Java concepts to make the backend robust and production-ready:

Servlets & JSP – For handling requests, responses, and dynamic web pages.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) – To connect with the database, store customer details, product inventory, and order records.

Session Management – To maintain user login state (admin vs customer) across multiple pages.

MVC Architecture – Separation of concerns between data (Model), business logic (Controller), and UI (View).

Exception Handling – Ensuring smooth error management during login, registration, and order placement.

DAO (Data Access Objects) – For clean and reusable database operations.

🌐 Role of HTML Forms
HTML forms play a crucial role in the project’s user interaction:

Customer Registration Form – Collects user details like name, email, password, and address.

Login Form – Provides fields for username and password, validated using JavaScript before submission.

Product Selection Form – Allows customers to choose items and specify quantity.

Admin Forms – Enable inventory updates and product management.

This project demonstrates the use of session management, exception handling, and database connectivity in Advanced Java, while HTML forms handle user input for registration, login, and product selection.
